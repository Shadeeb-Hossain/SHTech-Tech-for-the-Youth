This code is an example to identify breast cancer cell samples as "benign" and "malignant" using the machine learning algorithm of Logistic Regression.

There are eight factors considered significant in determining this classification. Initially, two factors—(i) cell size and (ii) marginal adhesion—are used as dependent variables for the classification, achieving an accuracy of 96%. However, the inclusion of additional variables can improve the efficiency to 98.8%.
Logistic Regression is used for the classification and evaluation metrics such as (i) F-score and (ii) ROC AUC was used to determine the accuracy of this model.
