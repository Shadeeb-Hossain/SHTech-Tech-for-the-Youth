This code is an example to identify breast cancer cell samples as : "benign" and "malignant" cells using the Machine Learning algorithm of Logistic Regression. 

There are eight factors that are considered significant to determine this classification as benign or malignant. Initially two factors : (i) cell size and (ii) marginal adhesion are used as dependent variables for the classification and accuracy of 96% was achieved. 
However, the inclusion of other variables can improve the efficiency to 98.8%
